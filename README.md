# Skoll
Skoll is, in norse mythology, a wolf who chases the sun, causing eclipses.


### Initially copied from https://github.com/DorianRudolph/sirula
This project started as a copy of Sirula project by Dorian Rudolph. I think I'll heavely rewrite/modify the code to archieve what I have in mind but I needed a starting point because I've never developed anything related to Wayland nor in Rust.

## Known bugs and missing features
- [x] Open apps must be immediately recognizable and monitor/workspace infos in the row
- [x] Open apps don't have to open a new instance but focus the existing one
- [x] Open GitHub provokes panic, it seems to be about the app_id being the display_name
- [x] Fullscreen background and UI refactoring
- [ ] Remove fixed size for fullscreen
