# Skoll
Skoll is, in norse mythology, a wolf who chases the sun, causing eclipses.

Please note that this is a personal project, for personal use, developed in my (not so much) free time. You'll not find clean code or a flexible, modular system here. You'll find lots of experiments, abandoned ideas, dead code, temporary hacks and workarounds. Oh, and last but not least, I'm just learning both Rust and GTK. You've been warned.

### Initially copied from https://github.com/DorianRudolph/sirula
This project started as a copy of Sirula project by Dorian Rudolph. I think I'll heavely rewrite/modify the code to archieve what I have in mind but I needed a starting point because I've never developed anything related to Wayland nor in Rust.

## Known bugs and missing features
- [ ] Move entries load after window opening
- [ ] Move Niri windows load after window opening
